## Overview

The British Airways Review Insights Dashboard is designed to:
- Evaluate overall customer service quality from review data.
- Map review scores and counts by country to reveal regional trends.
- Identify key service areas for improvement through targeted analysis.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to enhance customer satisfaction.

By integrating qualitative review data with geographic information, this dashboard helps stakeholders understand and address regional differences in performance.

## Data Sources

The analysis uses two datasets:
1. **ba_reviews.csv**  
   Contains customer reviews including fields such as overall ratings, service metrics, review dates, and written feedback.
2. **countries.csv**  
   Provides country information (e.g., country names, ISO codes, regional classifications) needed for geographic mapping.

These data sources are merged via a common country identifier, enabling a rich, multidimensional analysis.

## Data Preparation

Data preparation is performed in Tableau and consists of the following steps:

- **Importing & Profiling:**  
  Both CSV files are imported into Tableau. Data types (dates, numeric values, strings) are verified for accuracy.

- **Data Cleaning:**  
  - Standardize country names/ISO codes to ensure consistency.
  - Handle missing or incomplete review records (e.g., exclude entries missing critical rating data).
  
- **Joining Datasets:**  
  Merge **ba_reviews.csv** with **countries.csv** on the common country field.
  
- **Calculated Fields:**  
  Create additional fields, such as "Review Month" or "Season," to enable time-series analysis and further segmentation.

## Methodology & Analytical Workflow

**Tool Integration:**
- **Tableau** serves as the primary platform for data visualization.
  - **Data Blending & Joins:** Combines review and geographic data.
  - **Calculated Fields:** For instance, creating an `Average Overall Rating` field using `AVG([Overall Rating])`.
  - **Interactive Visualizations:** Line charts, bar charts, and maps are built to facilitate drill-down insights.
  
**Analytical Focus:**
- **Overall Service Quality:** Track trends in the overall customer rating over time.
- **Regional Variations:** Compare satisfaction scores across countries or regions.
- **Component Analysis:** Break down service-specific ratings (e.g., in-flight service, seat comfort).
- **Temporal Dynamics:** Identify seasonal fluctuations in review volume and sentiment.

## Dashboard Architecture & Design

The dashboard is structured with the following sections:

### 1. Summary Metrics (KPI Tiles)
- **Overall Average Rating:** Displays the aggregate customer rating.
- **Review Volume:** Shows total number of reviews.
- **Regional Spotlight:** Highlights the top-performing region based on selected criteria.

### 2. Time-Series Analysis
- **Line/Area Chart:** Depicts the trend of average ratings or review counts over time (aggregated by month).

### 3. Geospatial Visualization
- **World Map:**  
  - Uses color gradients or size encoding to represent average ratings or review counts by country.
  - Interactive tooltips provide detailed metrics when hovering over a country.

### 4. Comparative Analysis
- **Bar/Column Charts:** Ranks countries or regions by key metrics like average rating.
- **Filters & Dashboard Actions:** Enable users to dynamically filter by region, review date, or service category for personalized insights.

## Results & Findings

Preliminary analysis suggests:
- A consistent average overall rating across many regions, with identifiable peaks and dips over time.
- Variations in customer satisfaction across regionsâ€”some countries excel while others need targeted improvement.
- Specific service areas, such as in-flight amenities versus seat comfort, show nuanced differences that may guide strategic decisions.

## Challenges & Future Directions

### Challenges
- **Data Harmonization:** Ensuring consistency across country identifiers between datasets.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Extracting detailed insights from unstructured review texts.
- **Interactive Dashboard Design:** Ensuring seamless cross-filtering across multiple visual components.

### Future Directions
- **Enhanced Predictive Analytics:** Incorporate forecast models based on historical trends.
- **Advanced Sentiment Analysis:** Integrate with R/Python for more sophisticated text analytics.
- **Scalability:** Expand the model to include additional service metrics or customer demographics.

## Usage & Reproduction

To reproduce this project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
